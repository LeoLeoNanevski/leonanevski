### Professional Summary (The "Why")

Hello. I'm Leo. For over 12 years, I was the person on the ground in high-pressure logistics hubs (like TAV Airports and DHL Express). I was the end-user for the exact kind of software that IT companies build: I managed the 24/7 incidents, supported the software transitions (like ASYCUDA and CDEPS), and saw the "bug" from the operational side.

I decided to stop being just the user and learn to be the builder.

I've spent the last two years in a deliberate career pivot, training intensively in the Microsoft ecosystem. I didn't just learn "code"; I learned the specific tools of enterprise IT: **MS SQL**, **C#**, and **Microsoft Azure**.

I'm not a typical junior. I'm the "bridge" who speaks both languages: I can talk to a customs agent about a process bottleneck and then turn around and discuss the database schema or API endpoint with the development team.
